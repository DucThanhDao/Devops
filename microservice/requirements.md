# Proposed Architecture

## 1. Architecture Overview

The architecture will simulate a modern web application stack with microservices, database persistence, monitoring, and logging. It will include the following components:

### **Frontend Application**
- **Role**: Serves as the user interface for the system.  
- **Technology**: React.js (Single Page Application).  
- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive UI for users to interact with the backend services.  

### **Backend API Service**
- **Role**: Handles business logic and serves data to the frontend.  
- **Technology**: Node.js (Express framework).  
- **Purpose**: Exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume.  

### **Authentication Service**
- **Role**: Manages user authentication and authorization.  
- **Technology**: Python (FastAPI framework).  
- **Purpose**: Implements OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication.  

### **Database**
- **Role**: Stores persistent data for the application.  
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (Relational Database).  
- **Purpose**: Handles structured data storage for users, transactions, etc.  

### **Message Queue**
- **Role**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.  
- **Technology**: RabbitMQ.  
- **Purpose**: Decouples services and enables event-driven architecture.  

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Role**: Monitors system health and logs application events.  
- **Technology**: Prometheus (monitoring) + Grafana (visualization), ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  
- **Purpose**: Tracks system performance, errors, and logs for debugging.  

### **Reverse Proxy**
- **Role**: Routes traffic to appropriate services.  
- **Technology**: Nginx.  
- **Purpose**: Acts as a gateway for incoming HTTP requests.

## 2. Core Docker Concepts to Implement

Here are the key Docker concepts and features that will be used in this architecture:

- **Docker Images**: Pre-built images for each service (e.g., Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ).  
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of the images.  
- **Docker Networking**: Custom bridge networks to enable communication between containers.  
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage for databases and logs.  
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestration of multi-container applications.  
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Optimized Dockerfiles for smaller image sizes.  
- **Health Checks**: Ensuring services are running correctly.  
- **Environment Variables**: Managing configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod).

## 3. Solution Components

I have already prepared the following artifacts in my mind:

- **Dockerfiles**: For each service (Frontend, Backend, Auth Service, etc.).  
- **Docker Compose File**: To define and orchestrate all services.  
- **Configuration Files**: For Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.  
- **Scripts**: For initializing databases, seeding data, and running tests.
